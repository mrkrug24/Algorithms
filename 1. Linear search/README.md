1. Write a program that determines how many times a given number x occurs in a given array.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
In the second line, N numbers are entered – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
The third line contains a single integer x , not exceeding modulo 1000.
Output data
Print one number – how many times x occurs in this array.

2. Write a program that determines whether a given number x occurs in a given array.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
In the second line, N numbers are entered – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
The third line contains a single integer x, not exceeding modulo 1000.
Output data
Print YES if the number x occurs in this array, and NO otherwise.

3. Write a program that finds the element in the array that is closest in magnitude to a given number.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
The second line contains N numbers – array elements (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
In the third line, a single integer x is entered, not exceeding modulo 1000.
Output data
Print the value of the array element closest to x. If there are several such numbers, print any of them.

4. Write a program that outputs the numbers of array elements equal to this number.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
In the second line, N numbers are entered – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
The third line contains a single integer x, not exceeding modulo 1000.
Output data
Print the numbers of elements equal to this one in ascending order. If there are no such elements, you do not need to output anything.

5. Write a program that finds the value of the maximum element of the array.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
In the second line, N numbers are entered – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
Output data
Print one number – the value of the maximum element in the array.

6. Write a program that finds the number of the maximum element of the array.
Input data
The first line specifies one natural number N, not exceeding 1000 – the size of the array.
In the second line, N numbers are entered – array elements (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
Output data
Print one number – the number of the maximum element in the array. If there are several maximum elements in the array, print the number of any of them.

7. In connection with the visit of Emperor Palpatine, it was decided to update the composition of droids in Hangar 32. Due to the crisis, it was decided not to buy new droids, but to throw out a couple of old ones. As you know, Palpatine does not tolerate droids with small serial numbers, so all that is required is to find among them two that have the smallest serial numbers.
Input data
The first line of the input file contains an integer N – the number of droids. (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the second line is N integers modulo no more than 2*109 – droid numbers
Output data
Print two numbers: the first is the last largest of the droid numbers (this should be disposed of first), and the second is the penultimate.

8. An N × N table filled with integers is given. Peter the Great considers a column good if it contains the number X. It is required for each column to find out whether it is a good one.
Input data
In the first line is the number X, not exceeding modulo 2*109. In the second row, the number N (1 <= N <= 100), In the next N rows of N Integers not exceeding modulo 2*109 are the numbers in the cells of the table.
Output data
For each column, print YES if it contains the number X, and NO otherwise. (Each answer starts with a new line)

9. Hacker Vasily has gained access to a class magazine and wants to replace all his minimum grades with maximum ones. Write a program that replaces Vasily's estimates, but vice versa (all the maximum ones are minimal).
Input data
The number of Vasily's ratings is given (no more than 100), then the ratings themselves.
Output data
It is required to output the corrected estimates in the same order.
