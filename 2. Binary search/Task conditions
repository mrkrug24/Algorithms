1. Vasya made a number from 1 to N. For what is the smallest number of questions (to which Vasya answers "yes" or "no"), Petya can guess Vasya's number?
Input data
One number N is entered
Output data
Print the smallest number of questions, which is guaranteed to be enough for Petya to guess Vasya's number.

2. Implement a binary search algorithm.
Input data
The first line of the input data contains the natural numbers N and K (0 N K 100000). The second line contains N elements of the first array sorted in ascending order, and the third line contains K elements of the second array. The elements of both arrays are integers, each of which modulo does not exceed 109
Output data
It is required for each of the K numbers to output in a separate line "YES" if this number occurs in the first array, and "NO" otherwise.

3. Two lists of numbers are given, the numbers in the first list are ordered in non-decreasing order. For each number from the second list, determine the number of the first and last appearance of this number in the first list.
Input data
The first line of the input data contains two numbers N and M (1 N M 20000). The second line contains N non—decreasing integers - elements of the first list. The third line contains M non-negative integers - the elements of the second list. All numbers in the lists are 32-bit signed integers.
Output data
The program should output M lines. For each number from the second list, you need to output the number of its first and last occurrence in the first list. Numbering starts with one. If the number is not included in the first list, you need to output one number 0.

4. When Petya was at school, he often participated in Olympiads in computer science, mathematics and physics. Since he was a fairly capable boy and studied hard, he received diplomas at many of these Olympiads. By the end of school, he had accumulated a lot of diplomas, and, as it turned out, they all had the same dimensions: w — in width and h — in height. Now Petya is studying at one of the best Russian universities and lives in a dormitory with his classmates. He decided to decorate his room by hanging his diplomas for school Olympiads on one of the walls. Since it is quite difficult to attach diplomas to a concrete wall, he decided to buy a special cork board to attach it to the wall, and diplomas to it. In order for this design to look more beautiful, Petya wants the board to be square and take up as little space on the wall as possible. Each diploma must be placed strictly in a rectangle measuring w by h. Diplomas must not be rotated 90 degrees. Rectangles corresponding to different diplomas should not have common internal points. It is required to write a program that will calculate the minimum size of the side of the board that Petya will need to place all her diplomas.
Input data
The input file contains three integers: w, h, n (1 w h n 109).
Output data
It is necessary to output the answer to the task in the output file.

5. Given a real number a and a natural n. Calculate the root of the nth degree from the number
To solve it, use the method of dividing the segment in half.
Input data
The number a is real, non–negative, does not exceed 1000, is specified with an accuracy of 6 decimal places. The number n is a natural number not exceeding 10.
Output data
The program should output a single number: the answer to the problem with an accuracy of at least 6 decimal places.

6. Find a number x such that x^2 + sqrt(x) = C, with an accuracy of at least 6 digits after the dot.
Input data
The single line contains the real number 1 0 C 1010.
Output data
Print one number — the desired x.
