1. It is required to swap the first element of the array with the maximum.
Input data
In the first line, enter one natural number that does not exceed 1000 – the size of the array. In the second line, N numbers are given – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
Output data
Output the resulting array. If there are several maximum elements, you need to change the first one.

2. It is required to sort the array by non-decreasing using the "maximum selection" method.
Input data
In the first line, enter one natural number that does not exceed 1000 – the size of the array. In the second line, N numbers are given – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
Output data
Output the resulting array.

3. It is required to sort the array by non-decreasing by the "bubble" method.
Input data
In the first line, enter one natural number that does not exceed 1000 – the size of the array. In the second line, N numbers are given – the elements of the array (integers not exceeding modulo 1000).
Output data
Output the resulting array.

4. Determine how many exchanges the ascending bubble sorting algorithm will make for this array.
Input data
The first line contains the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) – the number of elements in the array. On the second line is the array itself. It is guaranteed that all elements of the array are different and do not exceed modulo 109.
Output data
Print one number – the number of bubble sorting exchanges.

5. The shoe store sells shoes of different sizes. It is known that one pair of shoes can be worn on another if it is at least three sizes larger. A customer came to the store. It is required to determine what is the largest number of pairs of shoes the seller can offer him so that he can put them all on at the same time.
Input data
First, the size of the buyer's foot is entered (he will not be able to wear smaller shoes), then the number of pairs of shoes in the store and the size of each pair. Size is a natural number not exceeding 100, the number of pairs of shoes in the store does not exceed 1000.
Output data
Print a single number — the maximum number of pairs of shoes.

6. Identify the three students with the best grade point average in three subjects. Print the surnames and names of these students. If, at the same time, several students have an average score that matches the average score of the student who "took 3rd place", then it is necessary to output them all.
Input data
The number of students n is given first, then n lines, each of which contains a surname, first name and three numbers (grades in three subjects: mathematics, physics, computer science). The data in the line is separated by a single space. The scores take a value from 1 to 5.
Output data
It is necessary to print the last name-first name pairs one per line, separating the last name and first name with one space. There is no need to output estimates. The output order should be the same as in the source data.

7. A natural four-digit number is given. Find the minimum natural four-digit number consisting of the same digits as the given one. Note that four-digit numbers cannot start from zero.
Input data
A natural four-digit number is entered.
Output data
Print the minimum natural four-digit number consisting of the same digits.
