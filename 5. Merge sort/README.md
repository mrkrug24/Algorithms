1. Two infinite increasing sequences of numbers A and B are given. The ith term of sequence A is equal to i2. The ith term of sequence B is equal to i3.
It is required to find Cx, where C is an increasing sequence obtained by combining sequences A and B. If there is a number that occurs in both sequence A and sequence B, then this number falls into sequence C in a single instance.
Input data
In a single line of the input file, a natural number x (1 ≤ x ≤ 107) is given.
Output data
Output Cx to the output file.

2. Sort this array using merge sorting.
Input data
The first line of input data contains the number of elements in the array N, N ≤ 105. Next comes N integers that do not exceed 109 in absolute magnitude.
Output data
Print these numbers in non-decreasing order.

3. Let's call two arrays similar if they consist of the same elements (without taking into account multiplicity). Use these two arrays to find out if they are similar or not.
Input data
The first line contains the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) – the size of the first array. In the second line there are N integers that do not exceed modulo 109 – the elements of the array. Next, the second array is set similarly.
Output data
The program should output the word YES if the arrays are similar, and the word NO otherwise.

4. Given N numbers, you need to find out how many of them are different.
Input data
The first line contains the number N – the number of numbers. (1 <= N <= 100000) The second line contains N numbers separated by a space, each not exceeding 2*109 modulo.
Output data
Print a number equal to the number of different numbers among the data.
